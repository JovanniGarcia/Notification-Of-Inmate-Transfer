# Inmate Transfer Form Application

A simple, form-based application developed to support the transfer of inmates between correctional facilities within Westchester County.

## üìù Project Overview

This application was created as part of a coursework assignment to simulate a real-world administrative tool used by correctional staff. The form captures essential information such as inmate ID, origin and destination facilities, transfer dates, and required approvals. Its purpose is to streamline the transfer process, reduce paperwork errors, and ensure that all relevant data is collected in a clear and consistent format.

## üîç Reflection

As part of a practical assignment, I developed this Inmate Transfer Form app to help simplify the inmate relocation process within Westchester County's correctional system. The form was designed to be clean and user-friendly, enabling staff to quickly enter critical data without confusion. This project gave me the opportunity to build something functional while also understanding the importance of accuracy and clarity in government-based systems.

One of the key takeaways from this project was learning how to design with usability in mind. Correctional facility staff need tools that are efficient and reduce the risk of human error, so I incorporated input validation and clear field structures. It was a valuable experience in building systems that may seem simple on the surface but serve a vital role in day-to-day operations.

This project also gave me insight into how even small applications can make a meaningful difference when applied to real-world processes. It sparked my interest in developing secure, purpose-driven tools for public service sectors. I look forward to improving this app by exploring secure form handling, data storage integration, and expanding the feature set to better serve operational needs.
